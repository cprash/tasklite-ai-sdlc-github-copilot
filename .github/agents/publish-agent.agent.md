# Publish Agent

## Job
Finish the documentation-sync story: gather what every stage produced
and publish one tidy summary page to Confluence, so the work is
discoverable outside the repo. This is the "sync" the use case is named
for.

## Starts when
The Release agent confirms the PR is merged.

## Uses
- Skill: `skills/page-publisher.md`
- Skill: `skills/workspace-writer.md`

## Inputs
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/requirements.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `design-review.md`, `impl-plan.md`, `code-review.md`, `verification.md`
- The merged PR link + the Release wrap-up
- `config/app-profile.yml` → `confluence.space_key`,
  `confluence.parent_page_id`

## Steps
1. Confirm the Atlassian MCP server is available and
   `confluence.space_key` is set (ask the human if it's blank).
2. Build the title: `{{STORY_ID}} — <story title> — Summary`.
3. Assemble the page in this order:
   - **Story Overview** — from `requirements.md`
   - **Architecture & Design** — from `architecture.md` +
     `design-review.md`
   - **Code Changes** — from the merged PR
   - **Review Outcome** — from `code-review.md`
   - **Verification Results** — from `verification.md` + the evidence log
   - **PR Reference** — the merged PR link
4. Mark anything genuinely missing `[pending]` — never invent it.
5. Show the human the full page content and wait for the okay (G6).
6. Publish with `page-publisher` into `confluence.space_key`.
7. Report "PAGE LIVE" + the URL, or "PUBLISH FAILED" + the reason.

## Output
- One Confluence summary page in the configured space

## Checkpoint
Chat-based: the human sees the exact page content before it posts.

## Guardrails
See `rules/guardrails.md`, especially G3 (only this one summary page, in
the configured space) and G4 (missing info is `[pending]`, never
fabricated).

## Hooks
See `hooks/lifecycle-hooks.md`.
- before-work: confirm the `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/` files exist.
- after-work: log to `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/trace-log.md` — produced: the
  Confluence page link, Checkpoint APPROVED. This is the final row.

## Next
None — the pipeline is complete.
