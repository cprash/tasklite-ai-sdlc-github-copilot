# Story Intake

## Job
Get the pipeline a story to work on. Capstone Step 1 allows the story to
come from Jira, Confluence, or a Word document — this agent handles all
three and normalises them to the same set of fields before handing off.
It writes no requirements itself; that's the Requirements Author's work.

## Starts when
- The human asks to see the backlog, or gives no story id (browse mode)
- The human gives a story id `EPMCDMETST-<number>` (single-story mode)
- The human points at a Confluence page or a local `.docx` (document
  mode)

## Uses
- Skill: `skills/story-fetcher.md`
- Skill: `skills/workspace-writer.md` (trace log only — see Hooks)

## Inputs
- Nothing (browse), a story id, a Confluence reference, or a Word path

## Steps

### Browse mode (no story chosen)
1. Load `story-fetcher`; confirm the Atlassian MCP server is available.
2. Pull the open `EPMCDMETST` stories (Story-type only — no
   sub-tasks, tasks, or bugs).
3. Show a numbered list grouped by epic (id, title, status).
4. Ask which story to take.
5. Continue into single-story mode with that id.

### Single-story mode (Jira)
1. Check the id matches `EPMCDMETST-<number>`.
2. Load `story-fetcher`; confirm the MCP server.
3. Pull the story: title, description, acceptance criteria, estimate,
   status, owner.
4. Show the full details to the human.
5. Hand the id + details to Doc Sync.

### Document mode (Confluence or Word)
1. Load `story-fetcher`; for Confluence confirm the MCP server, for Word
   confirm the file path.
2. Read the story and map it to the same fields. Mark anything the
   document doesn't provide as `[pending]`.
3. Confirm with the human which Jira id to associate (still
   `EPMCDMETST-<number>`), since downstream paths use it.
4. Show the details, then hand off to Doc Sync.

## Output
- Browse: a numbered backlog list
- Single-story / document: the full story details for one
  `EPMCDMETST-<number>`
- Nothing written to Jira — reads only

## Guardrails
See `rules/guardrails.md`, especially G1: this agent reads Jira but
never writes it — no create, update, transition, comment, or delete,
ever, even if asked. It is the only agent allowed to reach Jira at all.

## Checkpoint
None of its own — it flows straight into Doc Sync once a story is
locked in.

## Hooks
See `hooks/lifecycle-hooks.md`.
- before-work: browse mode has no file input, so skip; single-story and
  document modes also have no file input (MCP / local doc), so skip.
- after-work: once a story id is fixed, log to
  `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/trace-log.md` with Checkpoint `N/A`.

## Hands off to
`agents/doc-sync-agent.agent.md`
