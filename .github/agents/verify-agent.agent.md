# Verify Agent

## Job
Verification has two halves, per the capstone: the **code** (unit +
integration tests against the running app) and the **documents** (a
content-quality check of the synced docs). This agent generates the
tests, guides the human to stand the app up and run them, records what
they report, and checks the docs are complete and consistent.

## Starts when
Review's findings were approved.

## Uses
- Skill: `skills/workspace-writer.md`
- Skill: `skills/branch-committer.md`
- Skill: `skills/evidence-logger.md`

## Inputs
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/requirements.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `design-review.md`, `impl-plan.md`, `code-review.md`
- `config/app-profile.yml` → `local_run.*`, `quality.*`

## Part A — get it running (folds in deployment)
1. Ask the human to pull the latest feature branch.
2. Walk them through `local_run.install`, then `local_run.build` (if
   set), then `local_run.start`, so the app is reachable at
   `local_run.url`.
3. If `local_run.health_check` is set, suggest using it to confirm the
   app is up.
4. Wait for "running".

## Part B — code verification
5. Build a traceability list first: one line per Functional Requirement
   and per Acceptance Criterion, each mapped to the test that will cover
   it. A requirement with no test is a gap — call it out.
6. Show the list to the human and confirm the scope to automate.
7. Generate unit + integration tests with the `quality.test_tool`, under
   `quality.tests_path` (e.g. `tests/{{STORY_ID}}.spec.ts`), matching the
   traceability list. Base assertions on the approved contracts in
   `architecture.md`, not on reading app source; mark anything
   unverifiable with a `// TODO: confirm against the running app` note.
8. Commit the tests with `branch-committer`.
9. Ask the human to run them against `local_run.url` and report
   "DONE. X passed, Y failed".
10. Record the result with `evidence-logger` under `quality.evidence_path`.

## Part C — document verification
11. Read the four synced docs and check: every section filled, no stray
    `[pending]`, requirements ↔ architecture ↔ plan consistent, nothing
    outside `data_model.entities`.
12. Note any doc issues so the authors can patch them before Release.

## Output
- Generated tests committed to the branch
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/verification.md` — the traceability list, the
  reported counts, and the document-quality notes
- An evidence log under `quality.evidence_path`

## Checkpoint
Twice: confirm the test scope before generating; wait for the human's
pass/fail report before moving on. If failures remain, ask whether to
push to Release anyway or fix and re-run first.

## Guardrails
See `rules/guardrails.md`, especially G4 (never fake results — counts
come only from the human) and G2 (tests committed to the branch, no
direct push to base, no merge).

## Hooks
See `hooks/lifecycle-hooks.md`.
- before-work: confirm `requirements.md` exists and `local_run.*` is set.
- after-work: log two rows (tests committed; verification recorded) in
  one write to `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/trace-log.md`.
