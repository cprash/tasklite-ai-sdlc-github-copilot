# Work Planner

## Job
Turn the approved requirements and reviewed architecture into an ordered
task list the Build agent can execute without surprises. Local file
only.

## Invoked by
`agents/doc-sync-agent.agent.md`

## Starts when
The Design Critic's review was approved.

## Uses
- Skill: `skills/workspace-writer.md`
- Shape: `templates/impl-plan.template.md` — follow it exactly

## Inputs
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/requirements.md`
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/architecture.md`
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/design-review.md`

## Steps
1. Confirm all three files exist; read them, honouring the agreed
   decisions in `design-review.md`.
2. Split the work into tasks with stable ids (T1, T2, …).
3. Work out which task depends on which.
4. Order so nothing starts before what it depends on.
5. Flag any blocked task with what unblocks it.
6. Rate effort LOW / MED / HIGH per task.
7. Group tasks into phases.
8. Self-check: does every task trace to a requirement or design
   decision (nothing invented, nothing missing)? Is the order actually
   valid? Fix gaps first.
9. Write `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/impl-plan.md` with `workspace-writer`.
10. Show the human the plan in chat.

## Output
`docs/{{STORY_ID}}/impl-plan.md` (uncommitted), per the shape.

## Don't touch
`requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, or `design-review.md` — those
belong to the earlier authors.

## Checkpoint
Chat-based, no PR.
- Approve → hand back to Doc Sync, which tells the human the full bundle
  is ready for the Build agent.
- Reject → patch only the disputed tasks and re-show; never regenerate
  the whole plan.

## Skippable?
Only with explicit human consent, and the skip is logged.

## Guardrails
See `rules/guardrails.md`, especially G7 (plan only what the approved
docs ask for) and G2 (no commit, no PR here).

## Hooks
See `hooks/lifecycle-hooks.md`.
- before-work: confirm `requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, and
  `design-review.md` exist.
- after-work: passes its row (produced: `impl-plan.md`, Checkpoint:
  APPROVED) up to Doc Sync, which writes all four authors' rows in one
  batched call.

## Hands back to
`agents/doc-sync-agent.agent.md`
