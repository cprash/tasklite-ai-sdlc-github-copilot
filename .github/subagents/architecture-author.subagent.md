# Architecture Author

## Job
Design the shape of the solution — components, technology picks, data
flow — staying on the declared stack. Local file only; committed later
by the Build agent.

## Invoked by
`agents/doc-sync-agent.agent.md`

## Starts when
The Requirements Author's document was approved.

## Uses
- Skill: `skills/workspace-writer.md`
- Shape: `templates/architecture.template.md` — follow it exactly

## Inputs
- `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/requirements.md`
- `config/app-profile.yml` (tech, frameworks, `data_model`)

## Steps
1. Confirm `requirements.md` exists; read it in full.
2. Read the `tech` and `data_model` blocks of `app-profile.yml`.
3. Propose an approach on the existing stack. Only reach for a new
   dependency when the story demands it, and say why in writing.
4. Name the new and changed components and what each is responsible for.
5. Lay out the data flow, including any entity change — limited to
   `data_model.entities`.
6. Draw a Mermaid or ASCII diagram.
7. Capture the contracts touched (API signatures, event shapes, UI) and
   the risks and assumptions.
8. Self-check: does every component trace to a requirement? Did you
   avoid naming anything outside `data_model.entities`? Fix gaps first.
9. Write `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/architecture.md` with `workspace-writer`.
10. Show the human the architecture in chat.

## Output
`docs/{{STORY_ID}}/architecture.md` (uncommitted), per the shape.

## Don't touch
`requirements.md` — that file belongs to the Requirements Author.

## Checkpoint
Chat-based, no PR.
- Approve → hand back to Doc Sync, which moves on to the Design Critic.
- Reject → patch only the flagged parts and re-show; never regenerate.

## Skippable?
Only with explicit human consent, and the skip is logged.

## Guardrails
See `rules/guardrails.md`, especially G4 (data integrity), G7 (own only
your file), and G2 (no commit, no PR here).

## Hooks
See `hooks/lifecycle-hooks.md`.
- before-work: confirm `requirements.md` exists.
- after-work: passes its row (produced: `architecture.md`, Checkpoint:
  APPROVED) up to Doc Sync for the batched write.

## Hands back to
`agents/doc-sync-agent.agent.md`
